# clicky-game

PURPOSE: 
This app is created as a game where user can only click a image not more than once and score points.

OVERVIEW:
We have used React JS for this app. We have created components for Character to display all the images on the screen. We have used Header component
to display the app title and score on the Header. We have created character.json file to store all the images so that we can use it to 
display on screen.

HOW TO USE:
User will navigate to the app and will see 12 different pictures. Whenever user clicks the image it will increase the score by 1 and it will
randomly arrange all the pictures on screen. It will also display the message correct guess. If user clicks the same image twice. The game will
end displaying message incorrect guess and it will store the high score.
